DOCKER ARCHITECTURE : WHAT GETS INSTALLED WHEN DOCKER IS INSTALLED?
 * Docker architecture is client-server based and consists of several key components that work together to build, ship, and run applications in containers.

Docker Engine :
  * Core component that runs and manages containers.
  * Includes:
     * Docker Daemon (dockerd) – background service that handles container lifecycle.
     * REST API – allows programs to communicate with Docker Daemon.
     * Docker CLI (docker) – command-line tool to interact with Docker.

1.Docker Client :
  * The interface you use to interact with Docker (docker run, docker build, etc.).
  * Sends commands to the Docker Daemon.
  * Can run on the same host or remotely.

2.Docker Daemon (docker d) :
  * The background service that does all the heavy lifting.  
  * Responsible for building, running, and managing containers and images.
  * Listens for requests from the Docker Client. 

3.Docker Images :
  * Read-only templates used to create containers.
  * Can be pulled from Docker Hub (public registry) or a private registry.
  * Contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run.

4.Docker Containers :
  * Running instances of Docker images.
  * Lightweight and isolated environments for applications.
  * Share the host OS kernel but run independently.

5.Docker Registry :
  * Storage for Docker images.
  * Docker Hub is a popular public registry.
  * Private registries can be used to store images internally.

6.Docker Compose :
  * Tool to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file.
  * Allows running multiple interconnected containers as a single service.
  

Docker Workflow :
   1. Client sends command.
   2. Daemon executes the command.
   3. Images are pulled from the Registry if needed.
   4. Containers are created and run.
   5. Containers communicate via networks and can persist data in volumes.
