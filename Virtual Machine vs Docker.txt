VIRTUAL MACHINE :
  * A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs like a real physical computer.
  * It has its own operating system and applications, but it runs on top of another computer (called the host) using virtualized hardware.

1.Components:
   * Hypervisor: Software that creates and manages VMs.
     * Type 1: Runs directly on hardware (bare-metal).
     * Type 2: Runs on an existing OS (hosted).
   * Guest OS: The operating system inside the VM.
   * Virtual Hardware: Simulated CPU, memory, storage, and network.

2.Advantages of VM :
   1.Run multiple OS on one physical computer.
   2.Isolation – one VM doesn’t affect others.
   3.Easy to backup, copy, or restore.
   4.Good for testing and learning safely.

3.Disadvantages of VM :
   1.Slower than a real computer (performance overhead).
   2.Uses a lot of resources – CPU, RAM, storage.
   3.Requires hypervisor software.

4.Usecases :
  1.Running Multiple Operating Systems
  2.Software Testing and Development
  3.Server Consolidation
  4.Disaster Recovery and Backup
  5.Learning and Training
  6.Cloud Computing
  7.Running Legacy Applications
  8.Isolation & Security
  9.Temporary Environments
 10.Resource Optimization


DOCKER :
  * Docker is a platform that lets you package an application and all its dependencies into a single container, so it can run anywhere consistently.

1.Components :
   * Docker Engine – Core software that runs and manages containers.
   * Docker Images – Read-only templates used to create containers.
   * Docker Containers – Running instances of images, isolated environments for apps.
   * Docker Registry – Storage and distribution system for images (e.g., Docker Hub).
   * Dockerfile – Text file with instructions to build Docker images.
   * Docker Compose – Tool to run multi-container applications using a YAML file.
   * Docker Volumes – Persistent storage for containers.
   * Docker Network – Allows containers to communicate with each other or external systems.

2.Advantages of Docker :
   1.Runs the same way on any system.
   2.Starts quickly and uses fewer resources than VMs.
   3.Easy to run many containers for apps.
   4.Keeps apps and dependencies separate.
   5.run on laptops, servers, or cloud without changes.

3.Disadvantages of Docker :
  1.Linux containers work best; Windows containers have limitations.
  2.Setting up communication between containers can be tricky.
  3.Doesn’t virtualize hardware, so some workloads may need VMs.
  4.Beginners may find Docker commands and concepts confusing.

4.Usecases :
  1.Run multiple small apps in isolated containers (microservices).
  2.Create consistent development and testing environments.
  3.Automate app building, testing, and deployment (CI/CD).
  4.Run scalable apps on cloud platforms.
  5.Package old apps to run on modern systems (legacy apps).
  6.Test new software without affecting your main system.

DOCKER vs VM :
