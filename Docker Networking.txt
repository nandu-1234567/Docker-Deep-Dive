What is Docker Networking?
  * Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world.
  * Every container is connected to a network, which defines how it can talk to other containers or the host system.

Types of Docker Networks :
  1.Bridge Network (Default)
    * Default network for containers on a single host.
    * Containers can communicate with each other using IP addresses or container names.
    * Isolation from the host network.

  2.Host Network
    * Container shares the host’s network stack.
    * No isolation; container uses the host’s IP address.
    * Faster network performance, but less secure.
 
  3.Overlay Network
    * Connects containers across multiple Docker hosts.
    * Used in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for distributed apps.

  4.Macvlan Network
    * Assigns a unique MAC address to a container.
    * Makes the container appear as a physical device on the network.
    * Useful for legacy apps that require direct L2 network access.

  5.None Network
    * Container has no network access.
    * Completely isolated.


Docker Networking Commands :
    * docker network ls → List all networks.
    * docker network create <name> → Create a new network.
    * docker network inspect <network> → Show details of a network.
    * docker network connect <network> <container> → Connect a container to a network.
    * docker network disconnect <network> <container> → Disconnect a container from a network.
    * docker network rm <network> → Remove a network.


Docker Networking Workflow
  1.Container Creation
    * When a container is created (docker run), Docker assigns it to a default network (usually the bridge network) unless a specific network is specified.
  2.IP Assignment
    * Docker assigns the container a unique IP address within the network’s subnet.
    * This IP is used for container-to-container communication.
    * Container Communication
    * Containers on the same network can communicate directly using:
  3.IP addresses
    * Container names (Docker automatically resolves names via DNS)
  4.Port Mapping
    * To communicate with the host machine or external world, Docker maps container ports to host ports using -p <host_port>:<container_port>.
  5.Custom Networks 
    * You can create user-defined networks (docker network create) for better isolation and easier communication.
    * Containers on the same custom network can communicate by name.
  6.Multiple Host Communication
    * Using overlay networks (for Docker Swarm or Kubernetes), containers across different hosts can communicate as if they are on the same network.
  7.Network Management
    * Docker allows dynamic management of networks:
     * Connect/disconnect containers
     * Inspect network details
     * Remove unused networks
