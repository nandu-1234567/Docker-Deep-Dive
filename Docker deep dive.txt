1.What is Docker?
   * Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and all their dependencies into containers.
   * Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated, unlike virtual machines that require a full OS.

2.Docker Components :
Docker Engine :
  * Core component that runs and manages containers.
  * Includes:
     * Docker Daemon (dockerd) – background service that handles container lifecycle.
     * REST API – allows programs to communicate with Docker Daemon.
     * Docker CLI (docker) – command-line tool to interact with Docker.

 1.Docker Client :
  * The interface you use to interact with Docker (docker run, docker build, etc.).
  * Sends commands to the Docker Daemon.
  * Can run on the same host or remotely.

 2.Docker Daemon (docker d) :
  * The background service that does all the heavy lifting.  
  * Responsible for building, running, and managing containers and images.
  * Listens for requests from the Docker Client. 

 3.Docker Images :
  * Read-only templates used to create containers.
  * Can be pulled from Docker Hub (public registry) or a private registry.
  * Contains the application code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run.

 4.Docker Containers :
  * Running instances of Docker images.
  * Lightweight and isolated environments for applications.
  * Share the host OS kernel but run independently.

 5.Docker Registry :
  * Storage for Docker images.
  * Docker Hub is a popular public registry.
  * Private registries can be used to store images internally.

 6.Docker Compose :
  * Tool to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file.
  * Allows running multiple interconnected containers as a single service.
 
 7.Docker Volumes :
  * Persistent storage to save container data outside the container lifecycle.
 
 8.Docker Network :
  * Connect containers so they can communicate with each other or external systems.

3.Docker Architecture :
  * Client-Server Architecture:
     * Docker CLI (Client) → sends commands → Docker Daemon (Server) → manages containers/images.
     * Images pulled from Registry → used to create Containers.
  * Containers run isolated processes sharing the host OS kernel, making them fast and lightweight.

4.Workflow of Docker:
  1.Write a Dockerfile – instructions to build an image.
  2.Build Docker Image using docker build.
  3.Run Container from the image using docker run.
  4.Manage containers (start, stop, delete) using Docker CLI or Daemon.
  5.Push or pull images to/from Docker Registry.

5.Advantages of Docker :
   1.Runs the same way on any system.
   2.Starts quickly and uses fewer resources than VMs.
   3.Easy to run many containers for apps.
   4.Keeps apps and dependencies separate.
   5.run on laptops, servers, or cloud without changes.

6.Disadvantages of Docker :
  1.Linux containers work best; Windows containers have limitations.
  2.Setting up communication between containers can be tricky.
  3.Doesn’t virtualize hardware, so some workloads may need VMs.
  4.Beginners may find Docker commands and concepts confusing.

7.Usecases :
  1.Run multiple small apps in isolated containers (microservices).
  2.Create consistent development and testing environments.
  3.Automate app building, testing, and deployment (CI/CD).
  4.Run scalable apps on cloud platforms.
  5.Package old apps to run on modern systems (legacy apps).
  6.Test new software without affecting your main system.
