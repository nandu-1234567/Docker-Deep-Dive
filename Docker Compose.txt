What is Docker Compose?
 * Docker Compose is a tool to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
 * Instead of running multiple docker run commands, you can define all your containers, networks, and volumes in a single YAML file (usually docker-compose.yml).
 * It makes managing multiple services (like a web server + database) much easier.

Key Features :
 * Define services (containers) in one file.
 * Automatically set up networks and volumes.
 * Start all containers with a single command:
     docker compose up
 * Stop and remove containers with:
     docker compose down

Key Terms in Docker Compose :
   1.Service
     * A service is a container or a set of containers that perform a function in your application.
     * Example: web service runs Nginx, db service runs PostgreSQL.
     * Defined in the YAML file under services:.
   2.Image
     * A Docker image is a blueprint for a container.
     * It contains the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies needed to run a service.
     * Example: nginx, postgres.
   3.Container
     * A container is a running instance of an image.
     * Think of it as a “live app” running in an isolated environment.
     * Docker Compose creates containers automatically from the services’ images.
   4.Ports
     * Mapping ports lets your container communicate with the host machine.
     * Syntax: "host_port:container_port"
     * Example: "80:80" means external users can access the container’s port 80 via host’s port 80.
   5.Environment Variables
     * Variables passed to a container to configure it.
     * Example: POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD for a database.
     * Helps avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords.
   6.Volumes
     * A volume is a persistent storage outside the container.
     * Containers are ephemeral—if deleted, all data inside is lost.
     * Volumes keep your data safe even if containers are removed.
   7.Networks
     * Docker creates networks so containers can communicate with each other.
     * Each service can connect to a network by name.
     * Example: a web container can talk to a db container over a network.
   8.docker-compose.yml
     * The YAML file where you define all your services, volumes, and networks.
      Example :
         version: "3.9"  # Compose file version
         services:
            web:                 # Service name
              image: nginx       # Docker image for the service
              ports:
                - "80:80"        # Map host port 80 to container port 80
              networks:
                - app-network    # Connect this service to the network

            db:
             image: postgres    # Docker image for PostgreSQL
             environment:       # Environment variables for DB configuration
               POSTGRES_USER: myuser
               POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword
               POSTGRES_DB: mydb
            volumes:
             - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # Persist DB data
            networks:
             - app-network

            volumes:
              db-data:            # Define persistent storage for the database

            networks:
              app-network:        # User-defined network so web and db can communicate


Commands to Run This Compose File :
   * docker compose up         # Start all services
   * docker compose up -d      # Start all services in background
   * docker compose ps         # See running containers
   * docker compose logs web   # View logs for web service
   * docker compose down       # Stop and remove containers, network, volumes


Docker Compose Workflow :
  1.Write YAML file
     * Define all services (containers), ports, volumes, and networks in docker-compose.yml.
  2.Start containers
     Run:
       docker compose up -d
     * Docker Compose pulls/builds images, creates containers, sets up network & volumes.
  3.Containers run & communicate
     * Services automatically connect via the network.
     * Example: Web service can reach DB service using its name.
  4.Check status / logs
     * Check running containers:
         docker compose ps

     * See logs:
         docker compose logs

  5.Stop & clean up
     * Stop containers:
         docker compose stop
     * Stop & remove containers, network, volumes:
         docker compose down
