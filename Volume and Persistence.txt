DOCKER VOLUME :

What is a Docker Volume?
  * A Docker Volume is a storage mechanism that allows data to be stored outside a container.
  * It provides persistent data storage, meaning data remains even if the container is deleted or recreated.
  * Volumes are managed by Docker, making them easy to backup, share, and migrate.

Why Use Docker Volumes?
  * Containers are ephemeral: any data inside the container is lost when it stops or is removed.
  * Volumes help keep important data safe like databases, logs, or configuration files.
  * Can be shared between multiple containers.

Types of Docker Volumes
  1.Named Volumes – Managed by Docker, stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
  2.Bind Mounts – Maps a directory from the host machine to the container.
  3.tmpfs Volumes – Stores data in RAM; temporary and lost when container stops.
 

Key Commands
  * docker volume create myvolume → Create a new volume.
  * docker volume ls → List all volumes.
  * docker volume inspect myvolume → View details of a volume.
  * docker volume rm myvolume → Remove a volume.
  * docker run -v myvolume:/data myimage → Attach a volume to a container.


PERSISTENCE :

What is Persistence?
  * Persistence means keeping data safe and available even if a container stops, crashes, or is deleted.
  * By default, data inside a Docker container is ephemeral (temporary) and disappears when the container is removed.
  * Persistence ensures that important data (like databases, logs, configs) is not lost.

How Persistence is Achieved
  1.Docker Volumes – Preferred method for persistent storage.
  2.Bind Mounts – Map a directory from the host machine to the container.
  3.External Storage – Store data outside Docker, e.g., cloud storage or database servers.

Example :
    docker volume create myvolume
    docker run -v myvolume:/data myimage
 * Data written to /data inside the container will persist in myvolume, even if the container is deleted.
