Problem Docker Solves :

Docker solves the common challenges developers face when building, shipping, and running applications:

 1. “It works on my machine” problem – Applications behave differently on different machines or environments.
     Docker packages the app with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs the same everywhere.

 2. Dependency conflicts – Multiple applications may require different versions of libraries or runtimes. 
     Docker isolates each app in its own container, preventing conflicts.

 3.Environment inconsistency – Differences between development, staging, and production can cause failures. 
     Docker ensures a consistent environment across all stages.

 4.Complex setup – Installing databases, runtimes, and libraries manually is time-consuming and error-prone. 
     Docker simplifies setup using pre-built images.

 5.Scalability and isolation – Running multiple apps on the same machine can be messy. 
     Docker containers are lightweight and isolated, making scaling and management easier.
